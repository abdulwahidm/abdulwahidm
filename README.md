As a Software Developer I am passionate about building innovative products that solve real-world problems. I use my skills in Node.js, Golang, Python, and Java to create robust, scalable, and secure web applications and APIs.
I graduated from Hacktiv8 Indonesia, one of the most prestigious coding bootcamps in the country. There, I learned how to design, develop, and deploy full-stack web applications using modern technologies and best practices. I also gained valuable experience working on multiple projects with diverse teams, delivering high-quality results within tight deadlines. I am always eager to learn new things and challenge myself, and I strive to improve my coding skills and knowledge every day.
